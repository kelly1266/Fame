# Fame

Fame is a general purpose discord bot for my discord server using the discord.py rewrite.

## Note
Fame requires a bot token to run just like any other discord bot. Fame pulls its token from a file called config.py in the project folder. You will have create a file callled config.py and create the variable TOKEN with a string containing your own token in order to run Fame yourself.
